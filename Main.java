/*Java Variable types
You have 5 TYPES OF VARIABES IN Java
Boolean: True/False, only 2 state - boolean
Integers: Int , always WHOLE number
Strings: Text , ex "Hello"
Floats: Decimals, ex 19.99 or -19.99
Char: Single characters, "a", "B", WRITE A CODE THAT GIVE YOU HOW MANY CHARACTERS ARE IN "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"


In math x = 4 means 4 = x
In programming x = 4 (4 is assigned to x)

x = "patty"
b = "Tomato"
c = "Cheese"
d = "Bread"
e = "Lettuce"
f = "Ketchup"
g = "Mayo"

So the template is: type variable = value;
